# StackFlow

So this is supposed to turn into a sort of roidraged todo list based on how a stack works. 

If you gotta work on a subtask you add it to your stack, like a function call would be added. Get interrupted by a coworker?
Send an interrupt, saving your stack and creating a fresh new one.

Or something like that.
